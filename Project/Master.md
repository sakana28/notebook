cyclostationarity 循环平稳性 
循环平稳性是表现出某种周期行为的非平稳信号的特性
Cyclostationarity encompasses a subclass of non-stationary signals which exhibit some cyclical  
behaviour.循环平稳信号的一个典型示例是随机噪声，其幅度由周期函数调制。 A typical example of a cyclostationary signal is a random noise that is amplitude modulated by a periodic function.
