cyclostationarity 循环平稳性 
循环平稳性是表现出某种周期行为的非平稳信号的特性
Cyclostationarity encompasses a subclass of non-stationary signals which exhibit some cyclical  
behaviour.循环平稳信号的一个典型示例是随机噪声，其幅度由周期函数调制。 A typical example of a cyclostationary signal is a random noise that is amplitude modulated by a periodic function.循环平稳性的一个多功能例子是不同的周期调制覆盖随机噪声的每个频率分量。这种循环平稳特性非常适合许多旋转和往复机器振动，因为它们在运行过程中会保持固有的周期性调制。clostationarity has been shown to ideally fit  the property of many rotating and reciprocating machine vibrations,

fundamental observation to keep in mind： clostationarity is symptomatic to the presence of faults, owing to the occurrence of repetitive shocks when a defect impacts a rolling surface (a series of repetitive shocks may be seen as a signal periodically amplitude modulated in  time). 循环平稳性是缺陷存在的征兆，这是因为缺陷撞击滚动表面时会发生反复冲击。一系列重复的冲击可以看作是周期性地对振幅进行时间调制的信号。
