## 2 Image Edge Detection
Sobel Edge Detection is used to identify points in a digital image where the brightness changes sharply and discontinues. The  edge detection method reduces the amount of data in an image and preserves the structural properties  for further processing. In a gray level image, the edge is a local feature with in a neighborhood separate regions.The gray level is more or less uniform with in different values on the two sides of the edge. For a  noisy image, it is difficult to detect edges as both edge and noise contains high frequency contents, which  
results in blurred and distorted images.  Microsemi offers the Image Edge Detection IP that enables designers to use the edge detection for image processing.  The Image Edge Detection IP implements Sobel filter, which is a classical algorithm in the field of image  and video processing for the extraction of object edges. Sobel filter works on the premise of computing  
an estimate of the first derivative of an image to extract the edge information. By computing the x and y  direction derivatives of a specific pixel against a neighborhood of surrounding pixels, it is possible to  extract the boundary between two distinct elements in an image. Due to the computational load of calculating derivatives using the squaring and square root operators, fixed coefficient masks are adopted  as a suitable approximation in computing the derivative at a specific point. In the case of Sobel, the  
masks used are shown in the following figure.
